# Session Summary (2025â€‘04â€‘23)

## 1. What Could We Have Done Better?
* **Early Deployment Choice:** Using `gh-pages` on Windows hit pathâ€‘length limits. Next time, choose GitHub Actions from the start.
* **Smaller Commits:** We batched multiple UI tweaks and config edits into large commits; finerâ€‘grained commits aid review.
* **Node Modules in Git Status:** Accidentally attempted to stage `node_modules`; stronger `.gitignore` early on avoids noise.
* **Time Management:** Several reâ€‘runs of `npm run deploy` wasted cycles; reading the full error earlier would have pointed at Windowsâ€‘specific limits sooner.

## 2. Problems Encountered & Resolutions
| # | Issue | Resolution |
|---|-------|------------|
|1| Relationship lines / labels missing | Added `Relationships.jsx` & labels via `Text` from drei |
|2| Camera perspectives | Introduced stateâ€‘based view switcher, multiple cameras, styled buttons |
|3| Build fails in `npm run deploy` (ENAMETOOLONG) | Switched to GitHubÂ Actions (`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`) |
|4| Node modules accidentally staged | Hardened `.gitignore` |

## 3. Transcript Overview
The detailed chat transcript is available in the OpenAI thread. Key milestones:
1. Implemented relationships, labels, view switcher.
2. Styled controls, added GitHub badge.
