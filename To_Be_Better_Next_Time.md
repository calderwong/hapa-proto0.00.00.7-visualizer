# Retrospection: To Be Better Next Time - Hapa-Verse 3D Prototype

*(This file will be updated periodically at significant milestones)*

## Initial Setup (YYYY-MM-DD)

*   **What went well:** Scaffolding the basic project structure and standard documentation files was smooth.
*   **Friction points:** None significant during initial setup.
*   **Improvements:** Could potentially automate the creation of the standard file set (`README`, `dev_journal`, etc.) for new sub-projects.
